# Mitchell Tutorials

Mitchell is based on the Standard ML programming language.
Some useful external tutorials for Standard ML are:

- [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/standard-ml/)
- [Introduction to SML](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/introml/)
  - This tutorial gives instructions for the MoscowML interpreter. You can
    follow along by putting the code into a file and running `run-mitchell`
    instead of using the `mosml` interpreter. If you wish to follow along using
    an interpreter, the SML/NJ interpreter (`sml`) also will work, but you will
    not have access to the Mitchell libraries from the interpreter.
- [Programming in Standard ML '97: An On-line Tutorial](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/stg/NOTES/node2.html)

The following tutorials are specifically for Mitchell and Mitchell libraries.

- [Mitchell Programming Exercises](./vignettes.md)
- [Gradient Boosted Decision Trees](./tutorial-gbdt.md)
- [IO and Parsing](./tutorial-io-parsing.md)
