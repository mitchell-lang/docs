## Why does Mitchell say something is wrong at a spot in my code that looks fine?

Mitchell checks your code to make sure that you are using types of data in a
consistent way. It reports errors where it finds a problem, but that isn't
always where the root cause of the problem is. Details on how to pin down a type
error in your program can be found [here](faq/using-types.md).
