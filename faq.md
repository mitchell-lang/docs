## Why does Mitchell say something is wrong at a spot in my code that looks fine?

Mitchell checks your code to make sure that you are using types of data in a
consistent way. It reports errors where it finds a problem, but that isn't
always where the root cause of the problem is. See the aside at the end of the
[IO tutorial](/tutorials/tutorial-io-parsing.md) for details on how to pin down
a type error in your program: [A Note on Using Types to Help with
Development](/tutorials/tutorial-io-parsing.md#a-note-on-using-types-to-help-with-development).
